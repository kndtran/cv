%        \makeheading[right_object]{name}
%
% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.
% If ``right_object'' is provided in the square-braced optional
% argument, it will be right justified on the same line as ``name'' at
% the top of the CV. For example:
%
%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
%
%   \makeheading[\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{my_picutre}]{Your Name}
